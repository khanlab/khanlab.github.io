### About 
I am a PhD student in the Neuroscience graduate program. I received my BSc from University of Pittsburgh and MSc from the University of Texas at Dallas both in Neuroscience. My past research work has focused on memory and how it is effected by healthy aging as well as neurological diseases. Currently, I am working on quantitative MRI modelling of healthy ageing.
