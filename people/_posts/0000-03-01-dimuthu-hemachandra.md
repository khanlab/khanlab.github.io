### About 
I am a Ph.D. candidate in the School of Biomedical Engineering at UWO. I completed my undergraduate degree in Physics from the University of Peradeniya in Sri Lanka and I obtained my MSc. in Astrophysics from the University of Western Ontario. My current research project is focused on analyzing the structural connectivity of the brain using Diffusion MRI to find a biomarker for Parkinsonâ€™s disease.

PhD. student, Biomedical Engineering. co-supervised by Dr. Ali Khan & Dr. Penny MacDonald
