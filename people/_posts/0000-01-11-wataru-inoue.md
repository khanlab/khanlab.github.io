### About

Wataru Inoue (Associate Professor, Western University) is investigating cell-type-specific afferent and efferent connectivity involved in stress responses, with a focus on the top-down regulation of hypothalamic stress circuits. He will provide guidance on using AAV viral vectors and transgenic mouse models to expresses fluorescent and functional (DREADDs and optogenetics) proteins to achieve precise, cell-type-specific circuit mapping, and on translating these techniques to marmoset models.
