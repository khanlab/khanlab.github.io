### About
I am an MSc student in Neuroscience, also specializing in Developmental Biology. I received my Bachelor's degree at Western University in Medical Sciences, where I double majored in Physiology and Pathology. My current research uses ultra-high-field MRI to map structural and functional connectivity among key subcortical regions, particularly the amygdala and locus coeruleus, in children and adolescents.
