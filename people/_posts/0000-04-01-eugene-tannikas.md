### About
I am an MSc student in Neuroscience, also specializing in Developmental Biology. I received my Bachelor's degree at Western University in Medical Sciences, where I double majored in Physiology and Pathology. My current research focuses on using ultra-high field MRI scans to determine LC-amygdala connectivity in children with neurodevelopmental disorders.
