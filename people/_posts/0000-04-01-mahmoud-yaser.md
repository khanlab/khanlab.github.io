### About
I am an MESc student in Biomedical Engineering. I hold a BSc in Biomedical Engineering from Cairo University. My past research experience includes brain tumor segmentation and motion artifact correction using deep learning, as well as employing active learning to continuously enhance model performance in clinical settings. Currently, I am focused on improving automatic hippocampal segmentation for clinical infant brain scans.
