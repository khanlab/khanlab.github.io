### About

I am a PhD student in Neuroscience with a background in both Neuroscience (MSc) and Electrical Engineering (BSc). My research focuses on how cognitive control regions contribute to speech processing in noisy environments, as well as the normative mapping of functional brain responses. I am also deeply interested in using machine learning—particularly neural networks—as a framework for understanding brain function.
