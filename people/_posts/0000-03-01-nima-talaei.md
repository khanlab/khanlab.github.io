### About

I am a PhD student in Neuroscience with a master’s degree in Cognitive Psychology and a bachelor’s degree in Software Engineering. My current research focuses on understanding hippocampal structure and function and their relationship with behavior through neuroimaging. I am also deeply interested in applying machine learning, particularly neural networks, as a framework for understanding the brain.
