# mind.github.io 

The website was built using Jekyll and Github pages. Organization of the website 
is structured such that each page's associated data has a corresponding folder 
(if necessary) under `_data` and _`assets` (for images). The exception to this 
are individual pages, which are under `people/_posts`. Page templates and common 
elements are stored in `_layouts` and `_includes` respectively.

_A Jupyter notebook with a Github Actions cron job is utilized to update 
recent publications on a monthly basis._

The design of the website and use of Jekyll was inspired by 
[nbclab.github.io](https://github.com/NBCLab/nbclab.github.io).

All required packages are managed via 
[Poetry (v1.2.x)](https://python-poetry.org/). Click on the package link to see 
setup instructions.
_This is only required to run the Jupyter notebook._

## Updating website

See below for instructions on modifying each page. To modify or update a page, 
please make the necessary changes make a pull request to the repository! 

Netlify has been enabled to preview pages from pull requests. After making a 
pull request, the Netlify bot will comment (after a short time) with a preview 
link! This link will look something like: 
`https://deploy-preview-##--khanlab.github.io.netlify.app/` (where `##` is 
associated with the pull request number).

To preview these changes on your local machine prior to publishing, follow 
the instructions on the [following page](https://docs.github.com/en/pages/setting-up-a-github-pages-site-with-jekyll/testing-your-github-pages-site-locally-with-jekyll).

### `join`

This page contains information regarding recruitment. In the pages front matter, 
it includes 2 variables `postdoc_recruit` and `grad_recruit` - setting these to 
`true`/`false` will update the page with associated information.

For post-doc opportunities, updating the YAML file in `join/postdoc.yml` will 
add different available positions.

### `people`

This page contains all present and past lab members. Each member's profile can 
be found in a markdown file under `_posts`. Within the front matter of each 
these files, contains information such as email, department, a link to a 
profile picture (a placeholder is used if not provided). 

In order to facilitate sorting on the page, a `year-month-date` format has been 
utilized. The `year` and `date` are irrelevant, but the `month` is used to 
identify the member's role (e.g. Post-doc vs PhD). the mapping can be seen below:

```
01 - Staff
02 - Post-doc
03 - PhD Student
04 - Master's Student
05 - Undergraduate Student
```

A template has been drawn up and can be found in the `people/_drafts` directory. 

By clicking on each user's profile picture, a window will pop up with 
information in detail, including a short blurb about the user, if provided.

If you include an image and it does not show up on the website, please check to 
see if an image has been uploaded or if the path is correct!

### `news`

Similar to people, `posts` (found under `news/_posts`) are used to create 
articles. However, the date used here is important as it is used to sort and 
grab the latest articles.

### `software`
Similar to people, `posts` (found under `software/_posts`) are used to create 
and update the table of developed software. As before, these are sorted by date 
and is not currently relevant for this page.

### `publications`

A Jupyter notebook is used to grab all publications. Github actions is used to 
automate this process. This is updated monthly, and is currently set to display 
the 3 most recent articles. A full list of publications found is stored in a 
spreadsheet found in `_data/index/publications/publications.csv`.
