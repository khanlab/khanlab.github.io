blurb: "We have openings for students at the <strong>Master's</strong>
        and <strong>PhD</strong> level. Our current students come from a 
        diversity of areas that include computer science, engineering, 
        neuroscience, physics, and medicine to name a few.  We are a 
        multi-disciplinary lab, however, students with proven skills in 
        <strong>programming</strong> and <strong>scientific 
        computing</strong> will be at an advantage.  All students will 
        also be mentored by clinical collaborators relevant to their 
        thesis project. Western University provides a 
        rich and diverse environment for trainees, and I supervise 
        students in the Department of Medical Biophysics, 
        Biomedical Engineering and the Neuroscience graduate program. 
        I encourage you to apply directly to the University as soon as 
        possible if you are interested!"
