  <h2>About</h2>
  <hr />
  <p>
    The MIND Platform revolutionizes brain research by combining Canada's most powerful MRI scanner with cutting-edge microscopy technology. We capture incredibly detailed images of the brain at both large and small scales, helping scientists understand brain diseases like Alzheimer's and Parkinson's to develop better treatments. Our open science approach makes this powerful technology accessible to researchers worldwide.
